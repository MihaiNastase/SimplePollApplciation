# I_Feel_Great
### Walkthrough of project hierarcy:
* PollClass - A Class inside a class library; created to simulate a poll of responses from different users and containing the methods to calculte the percentage requested by the exercise.
* I_Feel_Great_CLI - A console application containing a simple CLI to assist the user in calculating the required percentage by inputing the number of responses from different users, based on gender and response type.
* I_Feel_Great_Xamshell_App - A mobile application for both Android and IOS platforms. It is a Xamarin.Form Shell app which serves the same purpose as its CLI version.

P.S. Hopefully the comments I have provided through-out my code will be of assistance to the person who will assess my work. Solving the exercise was a fun experience overall and hopefully I'll get to work more with mobile app development as part of the Beier360 team.

Kind regards,
Mihai
